## Service Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Entry Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `components/api-service` | API orchestration and HITL endpoints | `api_service.main` |
| `components/extraction-service` | Criteria extraction pipeline | `extraction_service.pipeline` |
| `components/grounding-service` | UBKG lookups and grounding | `grounding_service.ubkg_client` |
| `components/data-pipeline` | Protocol ingestion from ClinicalTrials.gov | `data_pipeline.download_protocols` |
| `components/evaluation` | Metrics and reporting | `evaluation.metrics` |

## Data Flow Summary

1. Protocols are ingested by `data-pipeline` into the database.
2. The API calls `extraction-service` to produce atomic criteria.
3. The API calls `grounding-service` to retrieve SNOMED candidates from UBKG.
4. The HITL UI reads and updates criteria and grounding decisions via the API.
5. Evaluation metrics and reports consume stored predictions and edits.
