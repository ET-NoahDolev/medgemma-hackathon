Extract clinical terms from this eligibility criterion:

Criterion: {{ criterion_text }}
Type: {{ criterion_type }}

{% if triplet %}
Pre-extracted triplet (use as hint):
- Entity: {{ triplet.entity or "N/A" }}
- Relation: {{ triplet.relation or "N/A" }}
- Value: {{ triplet.value or "N/A" }}
- Unit: {{ triplet.unit or "N/A" }}
{% endif %}

Instructions:
1. Identify all clinical terms that need UMLS/SNOMED lookup
2. For age criteria, use "Date of birth" with is_computed=true and computed_expression="floor((today - birthDate) / 365.25)"
3. Extract any relations (>, >=, <, <=, =) and values
4. Set logical_operator if multiple conditions are joined by AND/OR

Return a TermExtractionResult with the terms to look up.
