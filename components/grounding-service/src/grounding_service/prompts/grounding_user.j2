Ground this clinical trial criterion:

Criterion: {{ criterion_text }}
Type: {{ criterion_type }}

Follow this workflow:
1. Call interpret_medical_text to get MedGemma's clinical interpretation
2. For each identified concept, call search_concepts to find UMLS matches
3. Call get_semantic_type to determine field categories
4. Map semantic types to field categories
5. Extract relations (>, >=, <, <=, =, within, IS, IS NOT, AND, OR) and values from the criterion text
6. If the criterion implies a computed field (e.g., age), include a computed_as expression:
   - Example: "Age >= 18 years" -> concept "Date of birth", computed_as "today() - birthDate"
7. Always attempt to ground demographic or lab terms to a SNOMED concept via UMLS

Return a structured GroundingResult with:
- terms: List of grounded terms (snippet, umls_concept, umls_id, snomed_code, relation, value, unit, computed_as, confidence)
- logical_operator: AND/OR between terms when multiple conditions exist
- reasoning: Brief explanation of your analysis and tool usage
