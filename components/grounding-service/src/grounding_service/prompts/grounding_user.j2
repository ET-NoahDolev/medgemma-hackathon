Ground this clinical trial criterion:

Criterion: {{ criterion_text }}
Type: {{ criterion_type }}

Follow this workflow:
1. Call interpret_medical_text to get MedGemma's clinical interpretation
2. For each identified concept, call search_concepts to find UMLS matches
3. Call get_semantic_type to determine field categories
4. Map semantic types to field categories
5. Extract relations (>, >=, <, <=, =) and values from the criterion text

Return a structured GroundingResult with:
- snomed_codes: List of SNOMED CT codes found
- field_mappings: List of field mappings (field, relation, value, confidence, umls_cui)
- reasoning: Brief explanation of your analysis and tool usage
