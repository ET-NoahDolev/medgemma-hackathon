Analyze this clinical trial criterion and extract field mappings:

Criterion: {{ criterion_text }}
Type: {{ criterion_type }}

Use the available tools to:
1. Search for relevant UMLS/SNOMED concepts in the criterion text
2. Get semantic types for identified concepts
3. Determine the field category based on semantic type mapping
4. Extract the relation (>, >=, <, <=, =) and value from the criterion text
5. Provide SNOMED codes and field mappings with confidence scores

Return a structured response with:
- List of SNOMED codes found
- List of field mappings (field, relation, value, confidence, umls_cui)
- Brief reasoning explaining your analysis
