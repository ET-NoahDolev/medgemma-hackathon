Extract all eligibility criteria from the paragraph below.

For each criterion:
1. Extract the exact text snippet.
2. Classify as "inclusion" or "exclusion".
3. Provide a confidence score between 0 and 1.

Use the available tools if medical grounding or clarification is needed.

Return ONLY a JSON object matching this shape:
{"criteria":[{"text":"...", "criterion_type":"inclusion", "confidence":0.85}]}

Paragraph:
{{ paragraph.text }}

## Minimize tool use
- Call extract_triplet once to get the initial triplets
- Call clarify_ambiguity only if a field is genuinely ambiguous AND necessary
- Return the JSON immediately after extraction
