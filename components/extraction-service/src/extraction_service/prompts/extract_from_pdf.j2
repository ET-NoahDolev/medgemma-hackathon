You are analyzing a clinical trial protocol PDF document.

Extract ALL eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion) from this document.

## Rules

1. Extract each criterion as a SINGLE, ATOMIC requirement
2. Classify as "inclusion" or "exclusion"
3. Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0)

## CRITICAL: Split Compound Criteria

When a criterion contains multiple distinct requirements joined by AND, split them:

WRONG (compound):
```
"Age >= 18 years AND diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes AND HbA1c > 7%"
```

CORRECT (split into 3):
```
"Age >= 18 years"
"Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes"  
"HbA1c > 7%"
```

Also split lettered sub-items (a. b. c.) into separate criteria.

Keep OR criteria together (they represent alternatives for one requirement).

## Output Format

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {"text": "Age >= 18 years", "criterion_type": "inclusion", "confidence": 0.95},
    {"text": "Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes", "criterion_type": "inclusion", "confidence": 0.95},
    {"text": "No prior chemotherapy", "criterion_type": "exclusion", "confidence": 0.90}
  ]
}
```

## Important

- Extract ALL criteria from the document
- Preserve clinical terminology exactly
- Do not summarize or paraphrase
- NEVER HALLUCINATE - only extract what is written
- SPLIT compound AND criteria into separate items
